**Simple Three Layer Neural Network with AdaGrad and SGD**

This repository realizes neural network with AdaGrad and SGD, respectively. Using the program can help users to understand and research the implememtation and difference of the two approaches. The program can directly run on network packet dataset. The output of the program are vectors during the descent process, and the last vector is the final descent result.
